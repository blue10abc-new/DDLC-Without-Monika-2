Welcome back! I hope you enjoyed Part 1 from before. What? You haven't? Well go to https://github.com/blue10abc-new/DDLC-Without-Monika right now! Ready? Okay.

This mod does not outright remove Monika. It just makes you the president of the club instead of Monika. Download and extract the included mod's ZIP. Get the official DDLC game from ddlc.moe. Go into the game folder of the official game, and add the official game's images.rpa, audio.rpa, and fonts.rpa into the mod's game folder, or it will throw an error. Run the EXE (or SH for Linux) and enjoy! There will be save files as well as a default username which are remnants from my testing (IDK how to remove them). This is my first DDLC mod and my first Ren'Py project. Stay tuned for Part 3! All rights reserved by Team Salvato. This mod is a fan project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Team Salvato.
